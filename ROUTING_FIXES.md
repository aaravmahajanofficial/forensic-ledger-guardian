# Routing Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Duplicate BrowserRouter Issue**

- **Problem**: Both `main.tsx` and `App.tsx` had `BrowserRouter` components, causing routing conflicts
- **Fix**: Removed `BrowserRouter` from `main.tsx`, keeping only the one in `App.tsx`

### 2. **Enhanced Error Handling**

- **Added**: `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and handle routing errors gracefully
- **Added**: Improved `NotFound` page with navigation options and suggested routes

### 3. **Navigation Improvements**

- **Added**: `AppBreadcrumb` component for better navigation context
- **Added**: Route testing page (`/route-test`) to verify all navigation works
- **Added**: `RoutingStatus` component to show available routes based on user role

### 4. **Authentication Flow**

- **Enhanced**: Login form to handle success/error states better
- **Improved**: AuthContext navigation with proper timing to prevent race conditions

### 5. **Route Testing Tools**

- **Created**: `/route-test` page accessible from Help section and sidebar
- **Added**: Comprehensive route testing with both programmatic and Link navigation
- **Added**: Role-based route availability display

## Key Components Added

1. **RouteTestPage** (`/src/pages/RouteTest.tsx`)

   - Tests all major routes in the application
   - Shows both programmatic navigation (useNavigate) and Link navigation
   - Accessible via `/route-test`

2. **ErrorBoundary** (`/src/components/shared/ErrorBoundary.tsx`)

   - Catches React errors and displays user-friendly error page
   - Provides options to reload, try again, or go home

3. **AppBreadcrumb** (`/src/components/layout/AppBreadcrumb.tsx`)

   - Shows current location in the app hierarchy
   - Provides quick navigation to parent routes

4. **RoutingStatus** (`/src/components/shared/RoutingStatus.tsx`)
   - Displays available routes based on current user role
   - Shows navigation status and user authentication state
